# Task Summary:

=>Automatically monitor and rotate/delete large log files (e.g., NGINX and app logs) to prevent ```/var``` from filling up.
=>We'll do the following:
    1.understand the log location and setup.
    2.create a script to check the log file sizes.
    3.Rotate or delete log based on file size.
    4.Set up a cron job to automate this rotation/deletion.


# Set up a Linux ENV
## 1.Create a Docker File.
##```Dockerfile```
```bash
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y nginx cron gzip vim logrotate

# Create app log directory and dummy logs
RUN mkdir -p /home/devops/app/logs && \
    echo "Starting logs..." > /home/devops/app/logs/app.log

# Start shell on container run
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```
    This will get a base image for linux environment , install required tools , set up fake app log directory , initialize a dummy app log file and starts an interactive terminal when container runs.

## 2.Build and run the container
1.Build the image by ```docker build -t devops-logs .```
2.Run a container from the image by ```docker run -it --name logtest devops-logs```
